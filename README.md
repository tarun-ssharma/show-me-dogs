# show-me-dogs
A simple new tab app. Generates new random dog pictures for each of your new tabs and also allows you to toggle it on the fly.
This app I basically created in less than a week and is not a very good example as per the best practices go. Anyway, I made this for a particular person's birthday, and that's the best I could do in a short period of time :).

This extension uses the third party API https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random to fetch dog images.
